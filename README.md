### A streamlit app for spam classification

This repo contains a small app written in [streamlit](streamlit.io) which uses the model developed [here](https://github.com/zcline91/spam_filter) to classify a user-inputted email, formatted either as text (subject/body) or as a .eml file downloaded from an email client.
